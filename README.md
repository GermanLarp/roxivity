## Scammer/Larping locking accounts he's never owned
[Flipd thread where his multi got banned for selling a 2012 beamed off a dead kid](https://flipd.gg/Thread-Messias-scammer-selling-stolen-ticketed-accounts)
- Knew it was stolen off NLPMinecraft, still bought it anyway and even asked abt bans like it was any other account: https://imgur.com/a/rOZGgNg
- Tried to appeal the blockmania ban and even complained when it was denied. Clown world we live in where poor faggots think they can make money off reselling accs beamed off ogo.

  - This is definitely roxivity, even though he tried to be slick by using an alt. The messages were sent over a week before he sold it to richstage (the guy that made the DD) according to dates seen in the screenshot of the deal provided by roxivity himself in the DD: https://prnt.sc/JrTKIkDnKnKD

[Anxieted](https://namemc.com/profile/c8efda89-e4cd-4afb-bee8-66ddd052f0d0) is the only account I have concrete evidence of him scamming, so its the only one included in the paste.

Quoting from the flipd data leak:
> https://ogu.gg/Erxn is a multi of https://ogu.gg/Roxivity also a known German Scammer His real name is Eren https://postimg.cc/Kk7mqzks https://postimg.cc/2bNz7v6Z https://postimg.cc/cv64x02r https://mobile.twitter.com/roxivity his twitter also saying that hes a scammer If you ask Erxn what the names are hes gonna tell you that one of them is "Anxieted" which is owned by Roxivity (Eren) https://media.discordapp.net/attachments...nknown.png

Him admitting in his own shop discord that he locks accounts
https://ibb.co/MhGk7RD

Him saying that he would "lock anyone's accounts that were connected to Prevail" when Prevail scammed out. That is, everyone except vwv, isak, pceclown, eren, ethan, etc. 
Guess why? Because he's a harmless freak who knows he can't do shit to accounts without any ogi. Unfortunately, saffy bought his account off seyra, who is roxivity's business partner so he pretty much had ogi. I only realized after I bought Arina that he had owned it at one point or I wouldn't have bought it.

He almost didnt even lock safatron, assumingly because he thought he didn't have enough ogi since safatron is raped. Here's him pussying out on his promise to lock safatron.
Also, for some reason he wanted to lock Stroke. I don't remember if Prevail had already sold that account or not by the time he scammed out, but regardless roxivity wouldn't have been able to lock it because he had never owned it. Yet again more larping from this German nigger.

## Timewaster
Roxivity got butthurt that Prevail scammed him for $700, so he tried to lock prevail, **me, and saffy's** accounts. He was able to lock Rick (obviously) and safatron (because seyra was prev owner), but not Gel because he had no ogi (Didn't stop him from larping that he would like 5 times tho LMAO). Almost wasn't able to lock safatron and tried to play it off as if he was being merciful or some dogshit. Anything to preserve his massive ego.

I bought Arina weeks or months after the whole prevail-scammed-roxivity thing. I looked it up in MC Hub commands, roxivity saw it, locked it. I hit up roxivity to unlock the account a few weeks later. He started off by flexing that he had *"customers with requests to unlock accs worth $5-20k"* instead of just giving me a price. Eventually he gave me a price: the info to the (now locked) Rick. Obviously that wasn't going to happen, since prevail had completely left mc com by that point. Me and saffy got into a vc and convinced him to take money instead. It was $300 to unlock Arina and $100 to unlock safatron.

That was practically a month ago now and still haven't heard shit about my account, he's been dodging dms or just not answering. Saying shit like *"i couldn't do it because i didn't get the rep i wanted"*, or *"i was busy ill get to it later"* meanwhile he's been active on cheatbreaker (in 2024) for hours every day.

Until roxivity decides to stop egoing my dms this part will stay in the paste.

I can only imagine what the *"customers with $5-20k accounts"* needing to be unlocked by t.me/grave's unlock service are experiencing. Yes, the t.me/grave unlock service is provided by roxivity, even though they don't tell you that. Wonder why the self-proclaimed "super-trusted" OG com member roxjvjty wouldn't want his name on that little operation. Probably because *abso-fucking-lutely nobody* would pay **$3k minimum** for the service if they knew roxivity would have their $20k account's OGI.

## Crybaby
This nigga has been pissing and crying whenever shit doesn't go exactly his way for years.

Prevail scams him? *Lock Prevail, **me and saffy's** accounts.*
Mark autoclaims rage on a shit mfa because roxskibidi and evil were stupid enough to drop it when there's no guaranteed transfers? *Flip out on Mark as if it's his fault they're retarded.*

Also known to have locked other people's accounts when they shittalk him, then brag about it.

## Ego
Constantly claims to have *"$100k in mcs"* and claims to have owned *"multiple triple and double capes"*. Yeah, he did, back when they were worth like $2k. The multi capes he's owned recently were dogshit and he knows it. ign Booty is fucking raped, just check the owner hist on MC Hub. Vace is hyp banned and was probably beamed off ogo by kry, and was also pulled by kry when he scammed out. Everything else was shitty 15/16s, some hypixel or blockmania banned. Super fire double capes, roxy.

Acts like Madara is the best ign to ever touch com, when in reality its a shitty tranime mfa worth about $200.

Roxivity doesn't miss an opportunity to make sure everyone knows how "known and reputable" he is in com. He has a point, he is reputable in com. Reputable for being a FAGGOT NIGGER GERMAN SCAMMER. NOBODY TRUSTS THIS NIGGA WITH OVER $100 LOL

His main character syndrome is so bad, he unironically asked me if I "knew where my place in com is" while in vc with saffy. Anime main character voice and everything. How is this nigga even a real person.


PLEASE LAUGH AND POINT AND JEER AT THIS KRAUT LOSER WHENEVER POSSIBLE. THANKS!
