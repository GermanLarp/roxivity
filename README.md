## Timewaster
Roxivity got butthurt that Prevail scammed him for $700, so he tried to lock prevail, **me, and saffy's** accounts. He was able to lock Rick (obviously) and safatron (because seyra was prev owner), but not Gel because he had no ogi (Didn't stop him from larping that he would like 5 times tho LMAO). Almost wasn't able to lock safatron and tried to play it off as if he was being merciful or some dogshit. Anything to preserve his massive ego.

I bought Arina weeks or months after the whole prevail-scammed-roxivity thing. I looked it up in MC Hub commands, roxivity saw it, locked it. I hit up roxivity to unlock the account a few weeks later. He started off by flexing that he had *"customers with requests to unlock accs worth $5-20k"* instead of just giving me a price. Eventually he gave me a price: the info to the (now locked) Rick. Obviously that wasn't going to happen, since prevail had completely left mc com by that point. Me and saffy got into a vc and convinced him to take money instead. It was $300 to unlock Arina and $100 to unlock safatron.

That was practically a month ago now and still haven't heard shit about my account, he's been dodging dms or just not answering. Saying shit like *"i couldn't do it because i didn't get the rep i wanted"*, or *"i was busy ill get to it later"* meanwhile he's been active on cheatbreaker (in 2024) for hours every day.

Until roxivity decides to stop egoing my dms this part will stay in the paste.

I can only imagine what the *"customers with $5-20k accounts"* needing to be unlocked by t.me/grave's unlock service are experiencing. Yes, the t.me/grave unlock service is provided by roxivity, even though they don't tell you that. Wonder why the self-proclaimed "super-trusted" OG com member roxjvjty wouldn't want his name on that little operation. Probably because *abso-fucking-lutely nobody* would pay **$3k minimum** for the service if they knew roxivity would have their $20k account's OGI.

## Crybaby
This nigga has been pissing and crying whenever shit doesn't go exactly his way for years.

Previal scams him? *Lock Prevail, **me and saffy's** accounts.*
Mark autoclaims rage on a shit mfa because roxskibidi and evil were stupid enough to drop it when there's no guaranteed transfers? *Flip out on Mark as if it's his fault they're retarded.*

Also known to have locked other people's accounts when they shittalk him, then brag about it.

## Ego
Constantly claims to have *"$100k in mcs"* and claims to have owned *"multiple triple and double capes"*. Yeah, he did, back when they were worth like $2k. The multi capes he's owned recently were dogshit and he knows it. ign Booty is fucking raped, just check the owner hist on MC Hub. Vace is hyp banned and was probably beamed off ogo by kry, and was also pulled by kry when he scammed out. Everything else was shitty 15/16s, some hypixel or blockmania banned. Super fire double capes, roxy.

Acts like Madara is the best ign to ever touch com, when in reality its a shitty tranime mfa worth about $200.

Roxivity doesn't miss an opportunity to make sure everyone knows how "known and reputable" he is in com. He has a point, he is reputable in com. Reputable for being a FAGGOT NIGGER GERMAN SCAMMER. NOBODY TRUSTS THIS NIGGA WITH OVER $100 LOL

His main character syndrome is so bad, he unironically asked me if I "knew where my place in com is" while in vc with saffy. Anime main character voice and everything. How is this nigga even a real person.

PLEASE LAUGH AND POINT AND JEER AT THIS KRAUT LOSER WHENEVER POSSIBLE. THANKS!
